    Our team conducted a comprehensive integrity dig across Manitoba to assess and maintain the safety of the pipeline infrastructure. This proactive measure involved excavating a specific section of the pipeline to perform a thorough inspection, ensuring continued safe operation and compliance with industry standards.

  title: "Pipeline Integrity Dig Project"
  subTitle: |
    As part of our integrity management program, we conducted an integrity dig in Manitoba, beginning with advanced in-line inspection tools to identify potential pipeline anomalies. Upon detecting a feature requiring closer examination, we prepared the site by marking the access route and excavation area, carefully removing and storing topsoil separately from subsoil to preserve soil integrity. The pipeline was then exposed, and its protective coating removed for a detailed visual and instrumented inspection to identify corrosion, dents, or other defects. Based on the findings, we performed necessary repairs, including cleaning, recoating, installing sleeves, or replacing pipeline segments to restore integrity. Once maintenance was complete, the pipeline was recoated with advanced protective materials, the site was backfilled, and the area was restored to its original condition, with topsoil replaced and vegetation replanted. This project was completed efficiently, ensuring the pipeline's safe operation and full compliance with regulatory standards.
